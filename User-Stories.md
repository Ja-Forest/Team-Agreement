# User Stories

- As an administrative user for an organization I want the ability to edit and reassign tasks in a simple and efficient manner so my scheduling is flexible and quickly deployable to my team.

- As a non-admin user within an organization I want the ability to at a glance see my tasks for the day and be able to easily change my view so I can see my tasks for the week or month, and the ability to request black-out scheduling dates.

- As a student I want the ability to add SMS or email reminders to certain tasks that I am at risk of forgetting.

- As an administrative user for an organization I want to be able to add and remove team members from my organization to integrate new hires and dissociate ex-employees from the schedule.

- As a non-admin user within an organization I would like team mate and manager emails integrated into the team schedule so I can easily communicate with them to request schedule changes.
